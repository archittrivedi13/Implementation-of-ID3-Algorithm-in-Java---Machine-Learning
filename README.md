# Implementation-of-ID3-Algorithm-in-Java---Machine-Learning
ID3 algorithm is implemented in Java - Machine Learning Project

I implemented this project as a part of my Machine Learning Class in University of Texas at Dallas. ID3 is used to generate Decision tree 
from dataset. I have also provided input and partition as datasets required for input and output file that got generated as result.

If you want to implement it then you only require input and partition file for the same. Code is written in Java hence can be compiled and 
executed in Netbeans or Eclipse or even using command line. I have used Eclipse IDE for the same.  

HAVE FUN!
